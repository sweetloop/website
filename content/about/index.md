Opened on September 28, 2024, Sweet Loop is a locally-owned and operated cafe in Waterloo, Ontario that specializes in handcrafted churros.

#### Handcrafted Churros

Each churro starts with a secret recipe that's made into fresh dough, in store.
Never pre-made, Sweet Loop churros are piped from dough when ordered and fried in a special churro fryer imported from Spain.

Gently fried to perfection so they're golden-crispy on the outside and soft-fluffy on the inside, the exceptional quality and taste of Sweet Loop churros have customers coming back to order seconds.

#### Soft Serve, Matcha, and More

Churros are only the beginning.
Sweet Loop offers exceptionally rich soft serve ice cream, directly-sourced Korean matcha, espresso, and more.
There's nothing quite like a hot, fresh churro paired with soft serve and espresso&mdash;a trifecta of joy!

#### Top-Quality Ingredients 

Sweet Loop was started not just to provide churros and other desserts, but to provide the _best_ churros and desserts using only the _best_ ingredients.
From flour to milk to dipping sauces and everything in between, every ingredient is carefully sourced to ensure top quality in every product.

#### Warm and Inviting Store

The Sweet Loop store is a great place to enjoy its desserts: centrally located, lots of parking, wheelchair accessible, free Wi-Fi, and seating for about 15 people.
Meet a friend, bring your family, or come alone&mdash;everyone is welcome!
