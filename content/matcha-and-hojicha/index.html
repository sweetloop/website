			Hojicha is roasted matcha, which gives it a unique toasty flavor and lowers its caffeine content: just 0.7% compared to matcha’s 2.7%.
			Thanks to the roasting process, it’s naturally sweet, earthy, and has a smooth, chocolatey taste with no bitterness.
			Give it a try to find out why hojicha is quickly becoming as popular as matcha!

		Jeju Island, South Korea, offers ideal conditions for cultivating premium green tea and matcha: mild temperatures, abundant rainfall, and nutrient-rich volcanic soil.
		Its slightly acidic, mineral-rich water is naturally filtered through volcanic rock, enhancing flavor and quality.
		During harvest season, Jeju’s signature dense fog creates a natural shading effect, deepening the tea’s color and flavor for a rich, satisfying taste.
		All matcha and hojicha at <span class="slc">Sweet Loop</span> are sourced directly from a farm on Jeju island.
