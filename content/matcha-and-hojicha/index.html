		Jeju Island, South Korea, offers ideal conditions for cultivating premium green tea and matcha: mild temperatures, abundant rainfall, and nutrient-rich volcanic soil.
		Its slightly acidic, mineral-rich water is naturally filtered through volcanic rock, enhancing flavor and quality.
		During harvest season, Jeju‚Äôs signature dense fog creates a natural shading effect, deepening the tea‚Äôs color and flavor for a rich, satisfying taste.
		All matcha and hojicha at <span class="slc">Sweet Loop</span> are sourced directly from a farm on Jeju island.
