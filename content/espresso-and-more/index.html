			<h3>Espresso</h3>
			<p>
			<span class="slc">Sweet Loop</span> is a full-service espresso bar because great desserts need great coffee! Espresso shots, cappuccinos, lattes, Canadianos, cold brew, and the original: <i>drip coffee</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Churros are our specialty, but lots of people come just for the coffee because we use only <a href="https://detourcoffee.com/">Detour Coffee</a>.
			It's rich and perfectly balanced&mdash;the perfect dessert pairing!

			<h3>Rich Cream Smoothies</h3>
			Our smoothies, like our <a href="{{< ref "soft-serve" >}}">soft serve</a>, are thick and rich.
			The not-so-secret ingredients: a touch of cream and real fruit purees.
			So thick, they're served with a wide straw!
