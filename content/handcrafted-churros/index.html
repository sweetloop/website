	<h1>Handcrafted Churros</h1>
	<div>
		Our churros are made fresh from scratch every day, in store, and made to order when ordered.
		Nothing is pre-cooked.
		The recipe is our own.
		Every ingredient from flour to sauce is carefully sourced and selected, and we use only the best.
		It's more than dessert, it's a moment of joy.
	</div>

		<h2>Decorated Churros</h2>
		"Wow! I've never had a churro like that!"
		Decorated churros take the dessert to the next level by covering them in unique flavours like pistachio, Fruity Pebbles, double chocolate, and more.
		You can even create your own.

		<h2>Classic Churros</h2>
		Our classic churro is a best-seller.
		Coated in cinnamon sugar, it's the perfect blend of crunchy and fluffy: crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.
		Made hot and fresh... amazing!
		Classic goodness.

		<h2>Glazed Churros</h2>
		New kids on the block!
		(These churros, not the boy band.)
		When decorated churros are too much and classic churros are too little, glazed churros hit the sweet spot.
		Take a fresh churro and glaze it with rich dark chocolate, hazelnut, caramel, pistachio, or Biscoff.
		That's it, but it's fantastic!

		<h2>Dipping Churros</h2>
		Plain churro meets indulgent sauce.
		Result: wow.
		With only two parts (churro and sauce), each has to be amazing, and they are.
		No weak sauce here. Our dipping sauces are truly decadent:
		<ul>
		<li>Dark Chocolate</li>
		<li>Caramel</li> 
		<li>Hazelnut</li>
		<li>Pistachio</li>
		<li>Raspberry</li>
		</ul>
		Dip a fresh made-to-order churro in these sauces and you'll taste why they're so popular.
